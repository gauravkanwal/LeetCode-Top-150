## Key Ideas or approaches of the problems:  
  

## Q1. Merge Sorted Array  
  
**Problem link:** 
[Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  
The main key idea of this problem is to merge two sorted arrays in-place by starting from the end of both arrays. This prevents overwriting elements in the first array (nums1) while merging, as we place larger elements at the end first. The merging process is done by comparing the elements from both arrays and placing the larger element in the correct position of nums1.

We avoid traversing from the front because, if we started from the beginning of nums1, we would risk overwriting elements in nums1 that haven't been merged yet. Since nums1 has extra space at the end (to accommodate the elements from nums2), starting from the back ensures that we can safely compare and place the largest elements without disturbing the already-placed elements in nums1.

By starting from the back:

We can directly place the largest elements from both arrays into their correct positions in nums1 without worrying about shifting elements prematurely.
The last positions of nums1 (the extra space) are filled first, leaving the smaller elements to be placed at the start of the array.

## Q2. Remove Element  
  
**Problem link:** 
[Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  
The main idea of this problem is to maintain a writeIndex variable that keeps track of the index to be filled with a value distinct from val. We iterate over the array, and if nums[i] != val, we fill nums[writeIndex] with nums[i] and then increment both indices. If nums[i] == val, we only increment i, as writeIndex remains unchanged in this case.

## Q3. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array  
  
**Problem link:** 
[Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  
The main idea of this problem is to maintain a writeIndex variable that keeps track of the index to be filled with a value distinct from its previous one.  
As the array is already sorted this means the previous element from the writeIndex should not be the same as the new value that wants to be filled.  
We iterate over the array, We used (writeIndex<1) which means we fill the first index without checking anything as first element is always unique.  
For >=1 indices : if nums[i] != nums[writeIndex-1], we fill nums[writeIndex] with nums[i] and then increment both indices. Else if nums[i] == nums[writeIndex-1], we only increment i, as writeIndex remains unchanged in this case.

## Q4. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II  
  
**Problem link:** 
[Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  
The approach is same as the [previous problem](#q3-remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array).  
As here we can keep maximum of 2 duplicates we will check the second last element of writeIndex i.e. nums[writeIndex-2] should not be equal to the current nums[i] then only we will fill the writeIndex.
