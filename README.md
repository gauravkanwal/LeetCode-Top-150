## Key Ideas or approaches of the problems:  
  

## Q1. Merge Sorted Array  
  
**Problem link:** 
[Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  
The main key idea of this problem is to merge two sorted arrays in-place by starting from the end of both arrays. This prevents overwriting elements in the first array (nums1) while merging, as we place larger elements at the end first. The merging process is done by comparing the elements from both arrays and placing the larger element in the correct position of nums1.

We avoid traversing from the front because, if we started from the beginning of nums1, we would risk overwriting elements in nums1 that haven't been merged yet. Since nums1 has extra space at the end (to accommodate the elements from nums2), starting from the back ensures that we can safely compare and place the largest elements without disturbing the already-placed elements in nums1.

By starting from the back:

We can directly place the largest elements from both arrays into their correct positions in nums1 without worrying about shifting elements prematurely.
The last positions of nums1 (the extra space) are filled first, leaving the smaller elements to be placed at the start of the array.

## Q2. Remove Element  
  
**Problem link:** 
[Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  
The main idea of this problem is to maintain a writeIndex variable that keeps track of the index to be filled with a value distinct from val. We iterate over the array, and if nums[i] != val, we fill nums[writeIndex] with nums[i] and then increment both indices. If nums[i] == val, we only increment i, as writeIndex remains unchanged in this case.

## Q3. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array  
  
**Problem link:** 
[Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  
The main idea of this problem is to maintain a writeIndex variable that keeps track of the index to be filled with a value distinct from its previous one.  
As the array is already sorted this means the previous element from the writeIndex should not be the same as the new value that wants to be filled.  
We iterate over the array, We used (writeIndex<1) which means we fill the first index without checking anything as first element is always unique.  
For >=1 indices : if nums[i] != nums[writeIndex-1], we fill nums[writeIndex] with nums[i] and then increment both indices. Else if nums[i] == nums[writeIndex-1], we only increment i, as writeIndex remains unchanged in this case.

## Q4. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II  
  
**Problem link:** 
[Remove Duplicates From Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  
The approach is same as the [previous problem](#q3-remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array).  
As here we can keep maximum of 2 duplicates we will check the second last element of writeIndex i.e. nums[writeIndex-2] should not be equal to the current nums[i] then only we will fill the writeIndex.

## Q5. Majority Element  
  
**Problem link:** 
[Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  
Key Approach Summary for the Majority Element Solution:
Sorting the Array:

The array is first sorted, which has a time complexity of 
ùëÇ(ùëõlog ùëõ)
O(nlogn). Sorting ensures that if an element is the majority, it will appear consecutively in the middle of the sorted array.
Identifying the Majority Element:

After sorting, the algorithm calculates the required count for a majority element, which is more than half the size of the array (n/2).
A loop is used to check if any element at index i is the same as the element majority - 1 positions ahead. If such an element is found, it is identified as the majority element.
Efficiency:

The approach leverages the sorted order to efficiently determine the majority element with a single scan of the array after sorting.
Return Value:
The identified majority element is returned.
  
Another way of solving this problem is by using a HashMap.

## Q6. Rotate Array 
  
**Problem link:** 
[Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  
Key Points for the Solution:
Function Purpose:

The rotate function rotates an array nums to the right by k steps.
Handling Rotations:

k = k % n: This step minimizes unnecessary rotations. If k is larger than the array's length n, the effective number of rotations is k % n.
Reversal Method:

The reverse method is a helper function that reverses elements of an array within a specified range (start to end).
Rotation Logic:

Step 1: Reverse the first part of the array from index 0 to n-k-1.
Step 2: Reverse the second part of the array from index n-k to n-1.
Step 3: Reverse the entire array to complete the rotation.
In-Place Modification:

The solution rotates the array in-place, meaning it doesn't use any extra space for another array. It modifies the original array directly.
Time Complexity:

The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity because each reversal involves traversing part of the array, and in total, the entire array is traversed two times.
Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) as no additional data structures are used except for a few variables.
This solution efficiently rotates an array using a three-step reversal method, making it both time and space-efficient..

## Q7. Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock  
  
**Problem link:** 
[ Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  

An initial approach could involve using an array named max_profits to store the maximum number to the right of each element. The result is then calculated by subtracting each element from the maximum number to its right, with the maximum difference being the answer. However, this approach requires two traversals of the array.

We can optimize this by finding the result in a single traversal using the following approach:
Each element checks if it can generate more profit than the previous maximum profit. If the profit from the current element results in a loss (i.e., the profit is less than 0), we reset the currMaxProfit to 0. This approach is similar to Kadane's algorithm, where we track the maximum subarray sum to determine the best possible profit.

## Q8. Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock II
  
**Problem link:** 
[ Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  

The first approach I thought was to apply the last problem's approach to keep finding the profit for a stock until it is increasing . If the profit of a stock decreases at any point sell that stock on the previous  max profit and buy the new stock that gives less profit,
One better and simpler approach is to maintain a variable start and initialize it with first day's price and if price of the stock increases any day sell that stock and add the profit to maxProfit.Initialize start with current stock value after every iteration.

## Q9. Jump Game
  
**Problem link:** 
[ Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  

My key idea was that we iterate from right to left and if we find a 0 value that means it can cause problems. So we check to the left of 0 is there a value that can take us to the right side of 0.  
  
A more simpler code will for this approach that we initialize the variable goal with last index and i with second last index. And if we can reach to the goal from the ith index we initialize goal with the ith index.  
  
We check if we can reach to goal from ith index by :[ i + (maximum jump from i) should be >= goal ]

[View Solution üëà](./Solutions/Q9-JumpGame.java)  
  

## Q10. Jump Game II
  
**Problem link:** 
[ Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  

My key idea was that we iterate from right to left and use two pointers i and j where i=n-1 and j=i-1.
And iterate the array backwards from index j and find the minimum index that can take us to i and then increase the count .The next step is to make i=j , j=i-1 again and start iterating array again backwards and repeat the process until i becomes 0. This way we will find the minimum number of  steps needed to reach n-1 index . But this solution's time complexity is O(n^2).
  
So a O(n) approach would be to using a greedy approach to maximize the reach at each step while keeping track of the current jump's boundary.Whenever we find a new farthest reach we make connection with that index.
Breakdown of the central concepts:  
1. Farthest Reach:
At each index, calculate the farthest index that can be reached using the current jump. This ensures that we are always considering the maximum possible progress at every step.
2. Jump Boundary:
Use a variable (currentEnd) to track the end of the current jump range. Once you reach this boundary, it means you need to make another jump to continue progressing.
3. Greedy Decision Making:
Always aim to reach the farthest possible point with each jump. By making greedy choices, the algorithm minimizes the total number of jumps.
4. Efficiency:
This approach only iterates through the array once, updating the farthest reach and jump boundaries as necessary. By avoiding redundant calculations, the time complexity is reduced to 
O(n).
5. Termination Condition:
The loop stops as soon as the farthest reach is greater than or equal to the last index. This ensures that the algorithm doesn't perform unnecessary calculations once the goal is reached.
Example Walkthrough with Key Steps:
At each index:
Update farthest: Calculate the farthest index you can reach from the current index.
Check currentEnd: If the current index reaches the end of the current jump's range (currentEnd), increment the jump count and update currentEnd to farthest.
Stop when currentEnd reaches or exceeds the last index: This indicates that the last position is within reach with the current or next jump

## Q11. H-Index
  
**Problem link:** 
[H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  

 1. Bucket Counting:
- Instead of sorting the entire array, the code creates a **bucket array** where each index represents a specific number of citations.
- Each bucket (`buckets[i]`) counts how many papers have exactly `i` citations.

 2. Handling Large Citations:
- Any paper with citations greater than or equal to `n` (the total number of papers) is placed in the last bucket (`buckets[n]`). This effectively caps the maximum citations considered for the h-index calculation to `n`.

 3. Efficient Cumulative Count:
- The code iterates backward through the `buckets` array, accumulating the number of papers with at least `i` citations.
- Once it finds the largest `i` where the cumulative count of papers (`count`) is greater than or equal to `i`, it determines this `i` as the h-index.

 Why This Works:
- The h-index requires finding the maximum `h` where there are at least `h` papers with `h` citations. By using bucket counting, the code efficiently counts and accumulates citation data without the need for sorting, which would take more time.

 Advantages of This Key Idea:
- **Time Efficiency**: The bucket counting approach runs in O(n) time complexity, making it efficient for large datasets.
- **Space Efficiency**: The extra space used (bucket array) is proportional to the number of papers, making it manageable.

 Summary:
The key idea is to **use a counting mechanism (buckets)** to avoid sorting and directly determine the h-index by accumulating citation counts.

## Q12. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)
  
**Problem link:** 
[ Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) ](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  

Initially, we used a HashSet to store the elements, which ensured O(1) time complexity for insertion and removal. However, getting a random element from the HashSet was causing O(n) time complexity because HashSet does not allow accessing elements by index. We had to iterate over the entire set to get a random element, which was inefficient.

To improve this, we switched to a combination of ArrayList and HashSet. The ArrayList allowed us to access elements by index, making the getRandom() method an O(1) operation. However, when removing elements, we encountered the issue of not knowing the index of the element to remove, which led to O(n) time complexity for removal.

The key idea in the final solution is using both HashMap and ArrayList:

HashMap stores the element as the key and its corresponding index in the ArrayList as the value. This allows us to get the index of any element in O(1) time.
ArrayList allows us to access elements by index in O(1) time.
To remove an element efficiently, instead of removing the element directly, we swap it with the last element in the ArrayList and then remove the last element. This ensures that removal also happens in O(1) time.
Finally, the listSize variable keeps track of the current size of the ArrayList, enabling efficient random access and removal.
This approach ensures that all operations (insert, remove, and getRandom) are executed in O(1) time.

## Q13. Product of Array Except Self
  
**Problem link:** 
[ Product of Array Except Self ](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  

First Approach: Using Prefix and Suffix Products

Prefix Product Calculation: Create prefixProduct where each element is the product of all elements before it in nums.

Suffix Product Calculation: Create suffixProduct where each element is the product of all elements after it in nums.

Final Output: Multiply corresponding elements of prefixProduct and suffixProduct.

Time Complexity: O(n) (three passes through nums).
Space Complexity: O(n) (two additional arrays).

Improved Approach: Optimized Space Complexity

Single Output Array: Use a single array ans to store prefix products initially.

Combine Suffix Calculation: In a second pass, calculate suffix products and update ans on the fly.

Time Complexity: O(n) (two passes through nums).
Space Complexity: O(1) (ignoring the output array).

Summary

First Approach: O(n) time, O(n) space.

Improved Approach: O(n) time, O(1) space (excluding the output array).

## Q14. Gas Station
  
**Problem link:** 
[ Gas Station ](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)  

**Solution Key Idea or Approach:**  

Main key ideas for this problem are:
1. If total cost > total gas , there is no way to complete the rotation.
2. Else we only have to find the correct starting point . For this the main idea is that if you start at station i and can't reach station j, then no station k (where i < k ‚â§ j) can be the starting point either, because the gas accumulated between i and k is less than the cost.This allows us to skip certain starting points instead of iterating through all of them. So we put the next starting point direct as j+1.
  

Algorithm:

Calculate the total gas (totalGas) and total cost (totalCost).
If totalGas < totalCost, it's impossible to complete the circuit, so return -1.
Use a currentGas variable to track the remaining gas while traversing. If currentGas becomes negative at station i, reset the starting station to i+1 and reset currentGas.
